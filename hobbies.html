        <h2>Hobbies/ Interests</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I love trying new activities and exploring different clubs on campus. 
        Iâ€™ve joined a variety of clubs in the past to stay active, meet new people, or pick up new hobbies, 
        including Muay Thai, boxing, yoga, the shooting club, product management club, and the varsity outdoor club. 
        These experiences keep me energized and open to new challenges. <br> <br> Aside from that, I enjoy painting for my art page @kalabymaahi, where I focus on different styles of painting F1 cars. 
Painting has always been a way for me to stay concentrated, improve my precision, and hone my attention to detail.</p>
