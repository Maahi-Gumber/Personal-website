        <h2>Song Recommendation System </h2>
            <h3> Introduction </h3> 
            <p> This project utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and SciPy to build a song 
            recommendation system. It suggests songs based on input by analyzing key song characteristics like track ID, 
            artist, popularity, album, and playlist genre. Here's a link to github:

             </p>
            <h3> Dataset </h3> 
                <p> The dataset comprises 30,000 Spotify songs, sourced from Kaggle. After data cleaning, null values and 
                duplicates were handled, ensuring accurate feature representation.
                </p> 
            <h3> Methodology </h3>     
                <p> Key methods used include TF-IDF vectorization for string-based columns (e.g., artist, genre) and 
                standardization for numerical data (e.g., track popularity). These features were combined into a matrix for 
                similarity calculations using cosine similarity. The system then recommends songs based on the most similar 
                entries in the dataset.
                </p> 
            <h3> Conclusion </h3>
                <p> This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques for recommendation systems. 
                Future improvements could include enhanced evaluation methods and optimizing the recommendation algorithm.
