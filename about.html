            <h2> Maahi Gumber </h2>
            <p> Hey everyone! Welcome to my website! I’m Maahi Gumber, a fourth-year Statistics major at the University of 
            British Columbia. My passion for data analysis and statistics began in my first-year data science class, and deepened 
            during my time as a Research Assistant at UBC's Humbl Lab, where I gained hands-on experience in data collection and 
            analysis. Through projects like building a recommendation system and predicting Olympic medal counts, I’ve further 
            explored my interest in AI. In addition to my technical skills, I’ve developed strong communication and interpersonal 
            skills in roles such as Client Retention Specialist, restaurant server, and UBC Jumpstart Orientation Leader.
