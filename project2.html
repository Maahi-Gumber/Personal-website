        <h2>Olympic Medal Prediction System </h2> 
        <h3> Introduction </h3> 
            <p> This project focuses on predicting the number of medals Canada will win in the 2024 Summer Olympics 
            using historical data. By analyzing variables such as event participation, athlete age, and female 
            representation, we developed models to assess medal outcomes based on previous Olympic performances.

             </p>
            <h3> Dataset </h3> 
                <p> The dataset, sourced from Olympedia via Kaggle, included athlete bio data, event results, and 
                medal tallies spanning multiple Olympic Games.
                </p> 
            <h3> Methodology </h3>     
                <p> We utilized regression models, balancing interpretability and accuracy, to analyze the relationship 
                between variables such as entry count, athlete age, and event dates. Key features like multicollinearity 
                were managed to optimize model performance, providing a foundational approach for Olympic medal prediction.
                </p> 
            <h3> Conclusion </h3>
                <p> This project offers insights into predictive modeling for sports analytics, particularly in 
                Olympic performance. While the models provide a basis for predictions, further refinements with additional 
                variables could enhance accuracy.
